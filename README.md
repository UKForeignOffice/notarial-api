## Workspaces

* [api](./api/README.md)
* [worker](./worker/README.md)

### Getting started with Docker
You may use docker and docker compose to build and start the project with the right components (e.g. database, microservices), but will not be able to run the application(s) in dev mode.

To do this, simply run this command from the root of the project:
```
docker compose up -d
```

This will then run the server in a docker container in detached mode, allowing you to continue making commands through your terminal, but still keep the docker container running.

To rebuild the server after making some changes, run the following commands:

```
docker compose down
docker compose -d --build
```

### Running the applications locally (without docker)

You may still need docker to start the databases.


1. Start the database
2. 

### Formatting
This project uses ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistent formatting. It is recommended that you add and turn on the prettier plugin for your IDE, and reformat on save.


## CI/CD
There is a CI/CD pipeline currently set up for deploying new versions of the project to test environments. For more information, please refer to the [CI/CD docs](https://github.com/UKForeignOffice/notarial-api/blob/main/docs/ci.md)

## Testing
